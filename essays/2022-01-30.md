For BrowserHistory1, I watched the video before I start on my own. I think it is better to do this way because I will have some ideas in mind what is coming, and how difficult it is. I rewatched the videos 2 times before I start, the first time just an overview. The second time I stop at every steps and make sure I understand how it works, and know what does it mean in every steps. After that I started my own try, it is easier than I imagine. But sometimes I still need to go back to the videos to make sure I am doing the right things.

For BrowserHistory2, I think it is easier than browser history1 because I am more familiar with the html code like <h1></h1> or <body></body>… I tried it on my own after reading the instructions. It was easy for the first 2 steps, then I got stuck. I googled it online see if I can find something that might be helpful, I tried again and still get stuck on the CSS margins. Then I watched the videos to get some help, found out something wrong with my formate. After that I kinda figure out the CSS little by little. 

For BrowserHistory3, I personally think it is the hardest. I tried to do it myself after reading the instruction. I searched up something about the CSS heading formate, margins, heading style… I tried everything but still cannot figure it out. I decided to just watch videos and follow the steps. Then I find out I didn’t give identifiers in my html. So no matter what I type in CSS, nothing is going to change. After I followed the videos and finished BrowserHistory3, I walk through the steps by myself make sure I understand what I did.

My suggestions for WOD are: Read the instructions and see if you understand, try on yourself first. Search up on google if you are struggling with the code. Then try the code you think might work. If it still doesn’t work then go to the videos and look for hint. I personally think searching up yourself before watching the videos is better because we will have something in mind that what is not working and what is. I also learned a lot when I do the research.
